<p>overview.</p>


<h3><a name="data">2. Raw data</a></h3>

<p>The latest version of the HCWs antibody study is
available to download here:</p>
<ul class="circle">
  <li><a href="data/hcws2010.csv" title="Hong
  Kong Health care workers study data V1">HCWs2010data</a>.
</ul> 
<p>This version of the dataset covers the basic characteristics of HCWs, vaccine history, pH1N1 infection history, and serology results.</p>

<p>We provide our data under the <a 
href="http://www.opendatacommons.org/odc-public-domain-dedication-and-licence/">Open 
Data Commons Public Domain Dedication and License</a>, which is a version of open
access for data. Under this licence we reserve no rights: 
there are no restrictions on use of our data, and no requirement to cite
our work or this website. However we would anticipate that for academic purposes the
standard practice of referencing sources would apply. We would like to hear from 
researchers who are using our data and we would be keen to work together on analyses.</p>


<h3><a name="main">3. Main findings</a></h3>

<p>The primary findings from our main study have been
published in 
<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21501896"
title="full text of Zhou et al., 2011, JHI">Zhou et
al. (2011, JHI)</a>.

Our main findings were that.</p>

<p>Results described in Zhou et al. (2011) are reproduced in the
following scripts which can be run in
<a href="http://www.r-project.org" title="R statistical software homepage">R</a>:</p>

<h3><a name="further">4. Further work</a></h3>

<p>We have further analyses underway using the data from our study. More details will follow later.</p>

<h3><a name="authors">Authors and investigators</a></h3>

<p>The principal investigator of this study is
<a href="https://sph.hku.hk/en/Biography/Cowling-Benjamin-John">Ben Cowling</a>. The data were uploaded by 
<a href="https://sph.hku.hk/en/Biography/Cowling-Benjamin-John">Ben Cowling</a>, and the scripts were written by Joey Zhou, 
<a href="faculty_and_staff_detail.php?id=57">Vicky Fang</a> 
and <a href="https://sph.hku.hk/en/Biography/Cowling-Benjamin-John">Ben Cowling</a>.</p>


<h3><a name="comment">A comment on reproducible research</a></h3>

<p>We fully support the <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/EDE.0b013e318196784a">increasing calls</a>
from the academic community for 
<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/aje/kwj093" title="Peng et al., 2006, AJE">epidemiologic analyses to be reproducible</a>,
and <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1745-6215-10-17" title="Hrynaszkiewicz and Altman, 2009, Trials">raw data from randomized controlled trials to be published</a>, as a part of the wider scientific endeavour to
replicate results.
Another example of this recommendation is in the <a
href="http://www.qve-goodpracticeguide.org.uk/guide#TOC-2.4-Inputs">Good
Practice Guide for Quantitative Veterinary Epidemiology</a>. 
Here we have published the raw <em>anonymised</em> data from our
household transmission study. We have also published
scripts which allow the analyses in our published papers to be reproduced.</p>

<p>Thousands of local people have given their time, and their families', as part of their
participation in our studies,
all in the expectation that our research studies will add to medical and scientific knowledge.
Participants should also expect that we will make the best possible use of the information that
we have collected about them. It would be difficult to argue that facilitating
best use of the data by the research community need not involve releasing raw data.</p>

<p>Publication of anonymised raw data has been approved by our local IRB and funding sources,
and participants were advised that anonymised data would be published during the informed consent
process. We anticipate that release of the raw data will:</p>
<ul class="circle">
 <li>Promote reproducibility of our results.
 <li>Allow other investigators to conduct their own analyses on our data.
 <li>Allow other investigators to compare our data with theirs, for
   example to explore similarities and differences between research findings.
 <li>Allow other investigators to prepare and plan for their own studies.
</ul>
